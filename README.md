The repository will contain various projects covering:
- React with TypeScript fundamentals
- Component-based architecture
- State management (useState, useReducer, Context API, etc.)
- API integrations and data fetching
- Custom hooks and reusable utilities
- Advanced patterns (HOCs, render props, etc.)
- Performance optimizations and best practices

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Frontend Library:** React
